SQLAlchemy is a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. It is widely used due to its support for multiple database backends thus offering database portability and simplifying complex SQL operations.

PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system that is used for storing and managing data.    

FastAPI is a modern web framework built on top of the asynchronous Starlette framework. It leverages Pythonâ€™s type hints and the Pydantic library for automatic request and response validation, serialization, and interactive API documentation generation.
